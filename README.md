# NetWorm


> Python network worm that spreads on the local network and gives the attacker control of these machines.

This code is not finished and works more like a "worm template" for you to get inspiration at the moment. 

You can bruteforce ssh servers, spread with USBs, etc..



## Downloading necessary libraries

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Executing

Windows & Linux:

```
python worm.py
```

## Compilation (.exe)

Targeted machines wonÂ´t probably have python and the required libraries installed. 
To run this code on other machines, you need to convert it into an executable.



To use it, simply write these commands in your terminal:
```
pip install pyinstaller

pyinstaller worm.py
```
